# Shifting Morals
Shifting Morals is a thought experiment inspired by MIT's Moral Machine. However, instead of deterministic outcomes, Shifting Morals posits that outcomes are probabilistic and that everything is up to chance.

I am a high school student who is interested in artificial intelligence & machine learning. I built this website to explore both the boundaries of ethical consideration and in response to those who disagreed with the hard determinism of something like MIT's Moral Machine. With Shifting Morals, people can examine how chance plays a role in their decisions and how that influences their feelings about making choices.

I hope this website can provide not answers, but instead help provide the questions we should be asking when looking at machine ethics.
