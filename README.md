# Shifting Morals
Shifting Morals is a thought experiment inspired by MIT's Moral Machine. However, instead of determinstic outcomes, Shifting Morals posits that outcomes are probabilistic and that everything is up to chance.

I built this website to explore both the boundaries of ethical consideration and in response to those who the hard determinism of something like MIT's Moral Machine influenced their answers. I want to give those people an opportunity to examine how chance can play a role in their decisions and I want people to feel something based on the outcomes of their decisions. 

I hope this website can provide not answers, but instead help provide the questions we should be asking when looking at machine ethics.
