	    <p class="text-justify">
	    	I am a high school student who is interested in artificial intelligence & machine learning. I built this website to explore both
	    	the boundaries of ethical consideration and in response to those who disagreed with the hard determinism of something like MIT's Moral Machine. With Shifting Morals, people can examine how chance plays a role in their decisions and how that influences their feelings about making choices.
	    	<br><br>
	    	I hope this website can provide not answers, but instead help provide the questions we should be asking when looking at machine ethics.

	    <p class="text-justify">
	    	"Machine ethics (or machine morality, computational morality, or computational ethics) is a part of the ethics of artificial intelligence concerned with the moral behavior of artificially intelligent beings. Machine ethics contrasts with roboethics, which is concerned with the moral behavior of humans as they design, construct, use and treat such beings. Machine ethics should not be confused with computer ethics, which focuses on professional behavior towards computers and information." <br>-- Wikipedia
